# Building and Deploying AWS Lambda Functions with TypeScript and AWS CDK

This guide explains how to build and deploy AWS Lambda functions using TypeScript and AWS CDK.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- AWS CLI configured with necessary permissions
- AWS CDK
- TypeScript

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository containing your AWS CDK project.

```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

###  2. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies for your AWS CDK project.

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure AWS CDK
Configure your AWS CDK environment if not already configured.


```sh

cdk bootstrap aws://<AWS-account-id>/<AWS-region>
Replace <AWS-account-id> and <AWS-region> with your AWS account ID and preferred AWS region.
```

### 4. Update Lambda Handlers
Update your Lambda handler files in the lambda/ directory. Ensure they have the correct import statements, parameter types, and logic to handle requests.

### 5. Build TypeScript Code
Build your TypeScript code to generate JavaScript files.

```sh
npm run build
```

### 6. Synthesize AWS CDK Stack
Synthesize your AWS CDK stack to generate the CloudFormation template.

```sh
cdk synth
```

### 7. Deploy AWS CDK Stack
Deploy your AWS CDK stack to create or update resources on AWS.

```sh
cdk deploy
```

Follow the prompts to confirm the deployment. Once deployed, AWS CDK will create or update your Lambda functions and associated resources in AWS.

Additional Notes
Update the BUCKET_NAME environment variable in your Lambda handlers to match your S3 bucket name.
Ensure your AWS credentials are properly configured for deployment.
Review AWS CDK documentation for advanced configurations and options.
**Happy coding!**
